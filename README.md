# 2-gridrender

## Render a grid of colored squares onto the screen using OpenGL

- Start from a given template of OpenGL code to open a window and render a blank background, with one large square in the foreground.
- Change the code so it renders a 5 x 7 grid of colored squares on the screen, using vertex and index arrays with GL buffers and draw calls.
